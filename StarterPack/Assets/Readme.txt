Hello Omar!

This is my submit for first assigment.

You can move with the arrow keys or WASD with horizontal and vertical movement.

You can shoot the enemies with the right mouse button.

Enemies will follow the player until he dies, in order to kill the enemies you need to use the bullet that is the same color as the enemies, to change the bullet you use the next keys:
Number 1: Green Bullet
Number 2: Red Bullet
Number 3: Blue Bullet

The player rotates with the mouse (this is an old code I had)

Right now the game is "broken", so when the player dies the game doesn't have a game over or something like that, and as there is no longer player reference it will sent an error message.
